# Xtream Team

### Project Name: Secure Food Distribution App

### Team Members<br>
- **Prashant More**: Product Owner / Developer
- **Alexander Giannini**: Scrum Master/ Developer
- **Juan Valladares**: Developer
- **Anup Shetye**: Developer
- **Manav Agarwal**: Developer

### Product Name: 
The product is an open source using MIT licensed and it is called Supply Line Food.

### Far Vision<br>
 Build a solution to distribute food in underdeveloped countries.

### Near Vision Create an app that will build a basic framework for the far vision
Create web app that connect donors, non-profit orgs, vendors and families in need using QRCode technology.

### Stakeholders:
  
  - **Non-Profit User**: This stakeholder is a member of a non-profit organization and it will use the app to orchestate the distribution of food in underdeveloped countries. 

  - **Mother of Family in need**: This stakeholder use the app to create an identify in the system. The Local non-profit will coordinate the food's distribuition and locate those families that require support using the app.
  
  - **Man - Donors**: This stakeholder provide the funds to finance the process. He will use the app to donate money to the non-profit organization using creditcards or transfer money or any possible mean.  
  - **Groceries' Vendor**: Local vendors will give the groceries to the families in exchange of the funds received from the non-profit organization.  

  ### Real Person: 
  
Alejandra is a real person, is a mother of two, 31 years old who lives in Tegucigalpa, the capital city of Honduras. She works as office cleaner. Her husband work in construction. During the pandemic, both lost their jobs and have had difficulties to feed their family. Honduras, an underdeveloped country doesn’t have the resources to feed the whole country. This has been in lockdown since March and citizens can only leave their home once every 10 days. Some essential workers can go out, but they can’t because offices are closed, and construction work has been stopped. She has been struggling to feed her family and provide the basic needs. Food is one of the major issues due to the lack of job, money and they have to rely on some government assistance,  when it is possible, or non-profit such as churches or organizations that distribute food from time to time. Sometimes, they have to violate the lockdown to go out and look for groceries, or try to gain some money with temp jobs.

### Real Stakeholder

The family in need is a stakeholder that will be using the app but, at the same time, receiving the resources donated by donors.  It will sign up to request financial support, and the Non-Profit organization will give the funds when this person passes a vetting process. This process is essential because they will receive groceries with a monetary value, and it is necessary to make sure that this stakeholder requires financial assistance. 

The beneficiary will have an ID in the system, and this ID is used to identify the individual and make sure that the same person requesting help is the same person who will receive the goods at the store.
 
 
## Product Backlog
We are using Jira to manage our backlog and it can be seen this address [Jira Backlog](https://xtremeteam3.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1&projectKey=SFDA&view=planning&selectedIssue=SFDA-1&epics=visible&issueLimit=100)

### Ordering
<br>
For Product Backlog ordering, we decided to first implement the signup functionality, then the login functionaly, then the core functionality and then the security. We determined that this order will allow us to properly test the application due to technical constraints. Specifically, the creating the signup and login first will allow us to build the technical framework to power the rest of the application.

# Sprint 1

## Sprint Planning and Sprint Goal
For our first Sprint we forecast being able to complete 75 Story Points.  
Rational: While 75 points seems like a lot, we want to be sure to build a good foundation to build upon for the rest of the application. We are hopeful we will be able to complete everything especially considering Veterans Day is Wednesday and we may have a bit more time than normal.   

## Working Application
Our Product Increment is working software and can be found at: http://54.219.4.96:4200/

## Burndown Chart
The burndown chart is located in Jira [burndown chart](https://xtremeteam3.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1&projectKey=SFDA&view=reporting&chart=burndownChart&sprint=1&estimate=issueCount_). 

We did update our Sprint Task Board and Burndown Chart. However, becasue we modified our Product Backlog, there was a delay and all of our updates are logged as being started on 11/15.  

## Kanban Board
The Kanban Board contains the tasks we planned to accomplish this sprint. [Kanban Board Sprint 1](https://xtremeteam3.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1&projectKey=SFDA&selectedIssue=SFDA-21). 
 
## Mob Programming
We accomplished much of the first task using Mob Programming. We were able to maximize our productivity by pooling our strengths. Photos of our Mob Programming Session are included in the folder Sprint 1 Pictures.  

## Test First
We built our Application Test First. This is evidenced by ten functional test cases that all pass. The tests can be found at https://github.com/jcvalladares/xtreamteam/blob/main/sfda/src/test/java/com/sfda/users/UsersApplicationTests.java.

 # Sprint Review
 After the Sprint was completed, we conducted the Sprint Review. We discussed what we accomplished, our strengths, weaknesses, and what we want to acheive moving forward (notes are below).
 
 During our Sprint Review, Juan's friend Johana Salgado, (picture below) who is representing a donor, attended our session. She liked the work we had done during the sprint and commented on the layout and design of the home page. 
 
What did we accomplish? We completed the homepage and set the groundwork for the future product backlog items. We have the infrastructure in place and will be able to effectivly move forward.  

Strengths: We all have technical skills required for the Sprint. Our knowledge and experience complement eachother. We are all commited to the project and made the time to do the work.

Room For Improvment: Deeper knowledge of the technology. We could improve our communications. Better implementation of JIRA. Improve our knowledge of Agile. 
 
Goals Moving Forward: Have every team member engage with JIRA. We will send a Google Invite for every future meeting. We will use one zoom room instead of a new one every time. We will complete all of the items on our Sprint Backlog. We will continue to research the technologies.

Product Backlog Refinement: During our Sprint Reveiw, we received positive feedback from our stakeholder. She indicated that the design and layout was clear and understandable. As a result, we refined our product backlog by indicating, in the acceptance criteria of each new page, that it was neccessary to follow the Home Page's existing layout.
